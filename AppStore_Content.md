## Description (4,000 characters max)

TighterMenubar is a straightforward utility that gives you control over your macOS menu bar's spacing and density. If you've ever felt your menu bar items are too spread out or wanted a more compact layout, this app provides the solution.

**What it does:**
• Adjusts spacing between menu bar items (1-10 scale, from ultra-tight to system default)
• Controls padding around each menu bar item for precise clickable areas
• Provides real-time preview so you can see changes before applying them
• Works with your system's current font size and automatically adapts

**Key Features:**
• Clean, simple interface with sliders for spacing and padding control
• Live preview shows exactly how your menu bar will look
• Progressive scaling from level 1 (tightest) to level 10 (system default)
• Automatic font size detection and scaling for accurate results
• Host-specific settings - your laptop and desktop can have different configurations
• Graceful refresh system that updates your menu bar without requiring restart
• "Restore Defaults" option to revert to original macOS behavior

**How it works:**
TighterMenubar modifies macOS system preferences (NSStatusItemSpacing and NSStatusItemSelectionPadding) to achieve the spacing you want. The app uses research-based calculations to ensure accurate visual feedback and optimal results across different macOS versions.

**Requirements:**
• macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
• Administrator privileges to modify system settings
• Changes take full effect after logout/login

**Usage:**
1. Launch the app and use the sliders to adjust spacing and padding
2. Watch the real-time preview to see how your menu bar will look
3. Click "Apply" to save settings, or "Apply & Logout" to activate immediately
4. Use "Restore Defaults" anytime to return to original macOS behavior

This is an open-source project created to provide a useful service to the Mac community. No tracking, no subscriptions, no unnecessary features - just a simple tool that does one thing well.

Perfect for users who want to maximize their screen real estate, prefer cleaner interfaces, or simply want more control over their Mac's appearance.
